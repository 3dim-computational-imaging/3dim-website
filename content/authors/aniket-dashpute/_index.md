Aniket Dashpute is a PhD student at Rice University in the Computational Imaging Lab. He is also an affiliated member of the 3DIM Lab at the University of Arizona and works closely with Prof. Florian Willomitzer. His research focuses on computational imaging techniques using exotic sensors like event sensors, thermal cameras, and metaoptics. He has worked in 3DIM on event-based fast 3D imaging of scenes containing both diffuse and specular surfaces and on material classification using thermal spread functions. His current research includes metaoptics and generative models for event-based representations. He completed his MS in Electrical Engineering from Northwestern University in 2022 and his B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Delhi in 2018. He worked at Samsung Healthcare from 2018 to 2020 in the Computer Graphics team.
