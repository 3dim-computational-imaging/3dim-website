Jiazhang was the first Ph.D. graduate from the 3DIM Lab, earning his degree from Northwestern University in 2024. His research focuses on bridging computer vision and optical metrology. He developed “computational deflectometry” to expand the capabilities of traditional deflectometry, enabling new applications such as eye tracking.
