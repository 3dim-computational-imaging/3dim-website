Florian Willomitzer is an Associate Professor at the Wyant College of Optical Sciences - University of Arizona. He graduated in 2017 from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany, where he received his Ph.D. degree in Physics with honors (‘summa cum laude’). During his doctoral studies (PhD advisor: [Prof. Gerd Häusler](https://www.archiv.optik.nat.fau.de/forschung/osmin-former-group/)) Florian investigated [physical and information theoretical limits of optical 3D-sensing](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-10904-2) and implemented [sensors that operate close to these limits](/projects/fundamentallimits/). Concurrent with his Ph.D. activity, he was a freelancer in the research group’s spin-off company ‘3D Shape GmbH’(now part of [ISRA Vision](https://www.isravision.com/en/)) and he worked as a high school part time teacher for physics. Florian joined Northwestern University as Postdoc (Postdoc advisor: [Prof. Oliver Cossairt](https://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/people/oliver-ollie-cossairt/)) in Fall 2017, where he further shaped his current research profile. He became Research Assistant Professor in 2019 and started the [3DIM Lab at Northwestern](https://3dim.northwestern.edu/) shortly thereafter. In Fall 2022, Florian joined the Wyant College of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona as Associate Professor.   
Florian serves/served as Chair and Host of the Optica Incubator on [Imaging Through 100 Scattering Lengths](https://www.optica.org/en-us/events/incubator_meetings/2023/optica_incubator_on_imaging_through_100_scattering/), Chair and Committee Member of several [Optica COSI conferences](https://www.optica.org/en-us/meetings/osa_meetings/imaging_and_applied_optics_congress/program/computational_optical_sensing_and_imaging/), Optics Chair of the [2022 IEEE ICCP conference](https://iccp2022.iccp-conference.org/), Committee member of [Optica FiO](https://www.frontiersinoptics.com/), [DGaO](https://dgao.de/jahrestagung/), [ICMVA](https://icmva.org/), and [ODF](http://www.odf.jp/) conferences, and as a reviewer for the Nature portfolio (Nature, Nature Photonics, Nature LSA), Optica (formerly OSA), SPIE, IEEE, and CVPR.  
He is the [recipient of the NSF CRII grant](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/news-events/news/articles/2022/florian-willomitzer-receives-nsf-crii-grant.html), winner of the [Optica 20th Anniversary Challenge](https://www.optica.org/en-us/foundation/opportunities/competitions_prizes/20th_anniversary_challenge/), OSA Senior Member, and his Ph.D. thesis was awarded with the [Springer Theses Award for Outstanding Ph.D. Research](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-10904-2).
