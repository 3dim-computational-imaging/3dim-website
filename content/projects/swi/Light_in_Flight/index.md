In this project, we extend the capabilities of synthetic wavelength imaging by probing the scene at multiple synthetic wavelengths, effectively assembling a synthetic pulse. This synthetic pulse can then be computationally advanced to visualize light propagation (happening at the speed of light) in arbitrary volumetric scenes or through scattering media. The resulting “Synthetic Light-in-Flight” (SLiF) videos and measurements provide valuable insights into light-matter interactions on ultrafast timescales, enabling multiple potential future applications in, e.g., medical imaging, industrial inspection, or imaging through degraded visual environments. Typical light-in-flight approaches require specialized equipment, such as ultrashort pulse light sources and/or high-speed detectors. In contrast, SLiF uses only tunable continuous wave lasers and standard “slow” CMOS cameras. Moreover, the captured complex synthetic fields can be freely manipulated in the computer after their acquisition, which allows for spatial and temporal shaping of different sets of pulses from the same set of measurements to maximize the decoded information output for each scene. In addition, the relative speed at which the pulse travels through the scene can be used to characterize physical scene properties such as depth or indices of refraction.
