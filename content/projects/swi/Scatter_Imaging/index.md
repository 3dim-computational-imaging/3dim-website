The robustness of the synthetic field to scattering effects can be exploited to image hidden objects through scattering media or around corners. In many application examples, this can be done by performing holography at the synthetic wavelength, i.e., capturing a synthetic wavelength hologram (SWH) of the hidden object through the scattering environment. The SWH can then be computationally back propagated at the synthetic wavelength to reconstruct the obscured objects obscured. In our recent work, we have demonstrated both imaging hidden objects around corners (so-called “Non-Line-of-Sight imaging”) and through thin and thick volumetric scattering media via SWI. Moreover, we have developed a method to acquire the synthetic field information in single-shot, using only an off-the-shelf CMOS camera, which is crucial for the motion-robust measurement in scenes with moving objects and/or a moving imager and/or moving scattering media, like smoke, fog, or dynamic turbulence.
