(Multi-) line triangulation systems deliver a nearly perfect 3D profile of the measured part for each projected line in single-shot. However, the number of projected lines is limited by physical and information theoretical restrictions, leading to low data densities. This research track introduces novel concepts to increase the data density of multi-line triangulation up to the physical and information-theoretical limit, leading to accurate and dense 3D models. Each model is captured in single-shot, which allows for “3D-videos” of fast-moving objects. 

 In a related concept dubbed “Flying Triangulation”, we pair a “sparse” single-shot line triangulation sensor projecting ~10 straight narrow lines with sophisticated real-time registration algorithms. The captured sparse 3D line profiles are registered to each other ‘on-the-fly’ while the sensor is free-hand guided around the object, or the object is moved in front of the sensor (see videos). The result is a dense 3D model of the object with high depth precision.
