Fringe Projection Triangulation is known as one of the “gold standard” principles in optical 3D imaging due to its beneficial noise characteristics and the very high precision that can be achieved. However, the principle is designed for diffuse surfaces and suffers heavy artifacts when applied to shiny or specular surfaces. In this research track, we investigate novel computational and hardware-based methods to suppress the specular reflection component for a broad variety of “shiny” object surfaces, which allows us to measure these surfaces at high accuracy in single-shot using different flavors of Fringe Projection Triangulation. Moreover, we explore novel calibration paradigms that improve the measurement accuracy in industrial inspection settings.
