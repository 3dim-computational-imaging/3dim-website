Accurate, robust, and fast 3D surface measurements are crucial in modern medical imaging and can support a wide range of clinical applications from surgical guidance to telemedicine. For instance, providing surgeons with an accurate, real-time 3D view of the surgical field can be essential for complex procedures, e.g., in robotic-assisted or AR/VR-assisted surgeries. However, established techniques like structured light triangulation can face significant difficulties in surgical environments due to partially specular reflections from wet, bloody surfaces. Several of our developments aim to actively address these key challenges that have historically limited the use of advanced 3D surface measurement techniques in medical settings. Moreover, we are working on novel methods to enable high-quality 3D imaging using commodity devices like tablets and smartphones with the goal to make basic diagnostic tools, e.g., for the 3D analysis of skin lesions, more accessible. Additionally, our previous projects have focused on seamless co-registration of multimodal imaging data (MRI, EEG, MEG) and motion compensation during procedures like radiation therapy or CT imaging, leveraging real-time 3D sensing for improved results. 

Besides imaging the surface of the human body, a significant part of our research portfolio is devoted to imaging through scattering media, which has potential applications in medical imaging to image deep inside the human tissue (see [XXX UPDATE LINK XXX Synthetic Wavelength Imaging research track](https://example.com) for more info).
