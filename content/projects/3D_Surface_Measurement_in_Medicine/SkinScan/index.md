The “SkinScan” research track introduces a series of systems that only require commodity devices such as screens, (web-) cameras, low-end tablets or mobile phones to capture high-quality 3D data on human skin. For instance, one embodiment of the system exploits screen and front camera of mobile devices for photometric stereo-inspired 3d measurements. This can potentially enable several early diagnostics applications, including the 3D analysis of skin lesions. Due to their high sensitivity to high object frequencies, the systems can be also used to scan subtle skin features, like wrinkles or fingerprints.
