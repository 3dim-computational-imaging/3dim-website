Multi-line triangulation systems are highly effective for capturing precise 3D profiles of surfaces in single-shot measurements. However, physical and information-theoretical constraints limit the number of projected lines, resulting in relatively low data densities per single-shot for conventional techniques. This research track, aims for the development of novel concepts to push the data density of multi-line triangulation systems to their theoretical limits, enabling the creation of dense and accurate 3D models of the human body. Each model is captured in single-shot, which allows for “3D-videos” of fast-moving objects. In the related “Flying Triangulation” approach, a sparse line triangulation sensor projects approximately 10 narrow lines onto the surface while advanced real-time registration algorithms align the captured profiles. This method is particularly well-suited for free-hand scanning of the human body, or when the patient moves relative to the sensor. The developed techniques have demonstrated significant potential across various medical imaging applications, e.g., in EEG and MEG co-registration and source localization, or motion compensation during MEG and CT measurements and radiation therapy (see below).
