Fringe Projection Triangulation is widely regarded as a "gold standard" in macroscopic optical 3D imaging due to its excellent noise characteristics and the high accuracy it can deliver. However, the method is inherently designed for diffuse surfaces and encounters significant challenges when applied to wet, shiny, or bloody tissue surfaces, such as those found in open wounds. In this research track, we focus on developing novel computational and hardware-based techniques to suppress specular reflections and mitigate artifacts caused by these highly reflective, complex surfaces. Our goal is to enable motion-robust and accurate 3D measurements of tissue in surgical and medical contexts, by leveraging adapted single-shot Fringe Projection Triangulation methods. Additionally, we are exploring new calibration strategies tailored to the unique requirements of medical environments, further enhancing measurement accuracy and reliability for clinical applications.
