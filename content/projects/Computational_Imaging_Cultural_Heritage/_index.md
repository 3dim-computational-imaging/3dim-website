Computational imaging is a powerful tool for art and cultural heritage preservation and analysis, providing detailed, non-invasive and non-destructive documentation of paintings, sculptures, and even delicate objects like stained glass artworks or analog holograms, which are particularly prone to degradation. High-resolution digital (3D) models reveal surface details, structural features, and signs of wear, supporting condition monitoring and virtual restoration without risking damage.  

In several of our projects we have integrated these features in portable, hand-guided 3D imaging devices, which often consist only of off-the-shelf technology like ordinary mobile phones or tablets. This makes these methods more accessible to a wider user community and institutions.
