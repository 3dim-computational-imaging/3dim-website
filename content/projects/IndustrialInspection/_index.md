The fields of optical 3D metrology and computational imaging have spawned several high-quality 3D imaging principles in the last decades, with some of them able to reach accuracies in the 100μm range or even better. However, virtually all measurement principles reach their best performance either on purely diffuse or purely specular surfaces. Surfaces with “mixed reflectance” properties are still presents a challenge for current measurement principles. This is a contradiction, as only a fraction of objects around us have purely diffuse or purely specular surfaces. In particular, industrial inspection applications frequently need to deal with “shiny” metallic or painted parts, which present severe problems to state-of-the-art imaging solutions. 

In the 3DIM lab, we invent, develop, and build a series of 3D sensors that perform equally well on mixed reflectance surfaces as they do on purely specular or purely diffuse surfaces.
