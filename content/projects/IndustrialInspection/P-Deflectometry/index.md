Phase Measuring Deflectometry (PMD) is a well established method in optical metrology that allows for accurate 3D measurements of specular surfaces. Standard single-camera PMD setups suffer an inherent limitation: the height-normal ambiguity problem. Current solutions to this problem either require prior knowledge of the object's shape or exploit additional cameras, which impacts the compactness and usability of the device. In this research track, we propose a novel PMD paradigm that leverages polarization cues to solve the ambiguity problem. Our method is capable of simultaneously measuring the shape and normal field of complex surfaces without any prior knowledge about the object and without adding additional cameras.
