This research track introduces a series of systems that only require commodity devices such as screens, (web-) cameras, low-end tablets or mobile phones to capture high-quality 3D data: The developed “Mobile Multiview Deflectometry” system exploits screen and front camera of mobile devices for qualitative deflectometry-based measurements. It works without the need for a calibration and is optimized for specular surfaces. To compensate for the small screen, a multi-view registration technique is applied so that large surfaces can be densely reconstructed in their entirety. The “SkinScan” sensor principle uses the same hardware components but exploits photometric stereo-inspired algorithms for the measurement of matte object surfaces.
