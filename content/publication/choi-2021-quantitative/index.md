abstract: 'The presented work provides a way of preserving holography images through rendering the
holography images with NeRF and NeRF--, a neural radiance field representation method. This
paper explores the feasibility of interpolating photographs of holograms by using the neural
radiance field to synthesize novel views. Through quantitative analysis, it demonstrates that the
NeRF model is able to interpolate photographs of holograms.'
