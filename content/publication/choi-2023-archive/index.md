abstract: 'We introduce a novel method for the digital preservation of analog film holograms.
Our approach uses a machine learning-based approach dubbed Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF). We evaluate the performance of our method with both qualitative
and quantitative experiments, showing that analog holograms can be digitally pre-
served with high quality.'
